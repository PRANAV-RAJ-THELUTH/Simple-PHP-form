# Simple-PHP-form
A simple php form that contains html file and a php file that checks the login.
type username=admin and password=admin.
The save.php file works on the input fields.
Here in the html file for input fields username and password we give the attributes 'id' and 'name'
id attribute is used to control the input field from the client side
name attribute is used to control the inputs from the server side.
I use post method to transfer data.
